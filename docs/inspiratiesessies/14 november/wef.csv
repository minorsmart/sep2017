transition to the Fourth Industrial Revolution.,
"Underpinning the Report, the Global Human Capital",
Index provides a means of measuring the quantifiable,
elements of the world’s talent potential so that greater,
attention can be focused on delivering it. By measuring,
countries’ talent resources holistically according to,
"individuals’ ability to acquire, develop and deploy skills",
throughout their working life rather than simply during,
"the formative years, we hope to foster a true revolution in",
educational systems where education is geared to meeting,
the needs of the future workforce.,

human potential within the context of the Fourth Industrial,
"Revolution is one of the most important political, societal,",
economic and moral challenges we are facing today. Our,
work in the World Economic Forum’s System Initiative,
"on Shaping the Future of Education, Gender and Work",
provides a platform for leaders to collaborate on meeting this,
challenge. The System Initiative promotes the development,
"of education that matches the needs of the future, a",
"workforce that is better prepared for shifts in labour markets,",
opportunities for job creation and structures that allow for,
"gains and opportunities to be shared equally, regardless",
"of gender, age or origin. The Initiative offers the latest",
knowledge—including this Report—to leaders and the public,
"for more informed decision-making, provides an exclusive",
"platform for leaders to build consensus and share ideas, and",
works with leaders and organizations to take collaborative,
and coordinated action.,
