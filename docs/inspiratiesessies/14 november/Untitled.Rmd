title: "Read tables from pdf"
output: html_notebook
---

Use `pdftables`

```{r}
library(pdftables)

convert_pdf("http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Global_Human_Capital_Report_2017.pdf", "test2.csv")
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
